This creates a new branch, called `newdesign` in our example, in your local repository.
4. Make your changes.
5. `git commit`
6. `git push origin newdesign:newdesign`
This pushes your new branch called `newdesign` to your GitHub repository.

## Integrating your working code to master

When you have made your changes and tested them, please send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Before you start working

1. For your database.yml please copy config/database_example.yml (Example below in Mac OS X or Linux): 
	
	```
	cp config/database_example.yml config/database.yml
	```
	
2. Install [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (it depends on your OS)

3. [Create a PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-roles-and-manage-grant-permissions-in-postgresql-on-a-vps--2) user with the same name as your username

4. Install Bundler (if you don't have it already)
	```
	gem install bundler
	```

5. Install gems:
	```
	bundle install
	```

6. Create the database:
	```
	bundle exec rake db:create
	```

7. Run the database migrations:
	```
	bundle exec rake db:migrate
	```

8. Run the database seeds:
	```
	bundle exec rake db:seed
	```

9. Run the app:
	```
	bundle exec rails s
	```

10. If you build or test some admin features you have to create an admin user. You also can assign the status via the console:
	```
	rails c
	user = Profile.find(<your-profile-id>)
	user.admin = true
	user.save
	```

## Search
All above steps are necessary, then do:

1. Install Elasticsearch (e.g. using brew).

2. Start Elasticsearch by typing `elasticsearch`.

2. Import seeds from Postgres to Elasticsearch:
	```
	bundle exec rake elasticsearch:import:all
	```

3. Check to see if it is working.
This command fetches the total number of documents in the cluster:
	```
	curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_count?pretty' -d '
	{
	    "query": {
	        "match_all": {}
	    }
	}
	'
	```

4. To manually add entries to the index:
```
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/profile_index/profile/1?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "fullname": "Thuy",
  "twitter": "@example_thuy",
  "tag": "",
  "languages": "",
  "city": "",
  "country": "",
  "website": "",
  "bio": "Super interesting stuff...."
}
'
```

If need be you can delete everything on the cluster:
```
curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_all'
```
